## Healthy diets for people and the planet

<!-- 本文从讲述一个住在海边的人们为了经济不吃海鲜的故事引入，讲述了理想的饮食应该拥有以下两点特征：营养丰富、不威胁自然资源。
文章分为四个部分，第一个部分讲的是Iannotti和她的团队的实验。
Iannotti和她的团队在这个小镇进行了对照和追踪实验了解到“我们可以选择哪些对生态系统和饮食都有益健康的海产品”，得出“建议的饮食也应该是文化上可以接受的、负担得起的”的结论。
研究还发现由于不健康饮食导致的全球死亡人数超过了包括吸烟在内的任何其他因素，而且这些健康问题同时也带来了环境问题，如温室气体和水资源的污染。报告引起了人们对可持续饮食的关注，许多人们开始在相关方面进行研究。
第二部分讲述的是伴随粮食的生产而产生的温室气体污染已经远远超过其他生产活动。因为动物在将饲料转化为食物方面效率低下，科学家们制定了一个多样化的、以植物为主的饮食计划，。虽然迫于行业压力，想法被否决。但是它让人们更多地关注到了可持续发展问题。
第三部分是科学家们在说服人们采用健康、可持续的饮食方面做出的努力。他们发现人们从小养成饮食习惯往往会一直坚持到成年，于是致力于让人们从小养成可持续的饮食习惯以改善现在的饮食习惯带来的问题。
最后一部分道出了实现理想的可持续健康饮食的困难，如可持续的饮食的价格、饮食规定的食物无法获得等使得数百万人被拒之门外。
目前，各地科学家都在因地制宜的方向上努力着，他们将重心先放在的人们更关心的地方，朝着这些社区感兴趣的结果努力。 -->
The article begins with a story about a person who lives by the sea and does not eat seafood for the sake of economy, and describes how the ideal diet should have two characteristics: it is nutritious and does not threaten natural resources.
The article is divided into four parts, the first of which is about Iannotti and her team's experiment.
Iannotti and her team conducted controlled and tracked experiments in the town to understand "which seafood choices we can make that are healthy for the ecosystem and our diet", and concluded that "the recommended diet should also be culturally acceptable and affordable". ".
The study also found that unhealthy diets are responsible for more global deaths than any other factor, including smoking, and that these health problems are accompanied by environmental problems, such as greenhouse gases and water pollution. The report has drawn attention to sustainable diets and many people are beginning to conduct research in this area.
The second section deals with the fact that the greenhouse gas pollution that accompanies the production of food already far exceeds that of other production activities. Because of the inefficiency of animals in converting feed into food, scientists have developed a diverse, plant-based diet plan,. Although the idea was rejected due to industry pressure. But it brought more attention to the issue of sustainability.
The third part is the scientists' efforts in convincing people to adopt a healthy, sustainable diet. They found that people tend to adopt eating habits from an early age and continue to do so into adulthood, so they worked to get people to adopt sustainable eating habits from an early age to improve the problems caused by their current eating habits.
The last section speaks to the difficulties of achieving an ideal sustainable and healthy diet, such as the price of a sustainable diet, and the inaccessibility of foods prescribed by the diet that keep millions of people away.
Currently, scientists around the world are working in localised directions, focusing first on what people care more about and working towards outcomes that are of interest to these communities.
