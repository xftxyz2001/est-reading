## Summary

Healthy diets for people and the planet
---
本文主要讲述的是科学家们在理解到现有的饮食方式的缺点时为了寻找到同时兼顾人体营养与自然环境的饮食方式所做出的探究与实验。  
本文首先描述了Lora Iannotti和她的肯尼亚同事在肯尼亚的肯尼亚蒙巴萨所作的一个小实验已了解"我们可以选择哪些海洋食物对生态系统健康以及在饮食中健康"。科学家们发现目前为止人们的饮食习惯不仅对人们造成了比较严重的健康问题，而且对于现有的环境还会造成较大的伤害。  
鉴于这种情况他们联合发布了一份呼吁大家进行饮食改变的报告。饮食方式主要产生的环境问题是伴随食物的产生会产生大量的温室气体污染，于是科学家们呼吁人们改变为以植物性食物为主的饮食并制定了由整体食物组成的基本健康食谱。他们受到了来自各个方面的不少批评。一些科学家采取了另一种方式，他们致力于让人们从小养成可持续的饮食习惯以解决现有饮食习惯所带来的的种种问题，并改善了上文的饮食结构。  
但让所有人都实现这样的健康饮食显然是不太可能的，现实中存在着种种阻力。最首先的是找出一些低收入或中收入地区的人们在吃什么。一位科学家还指出利用现有的资源在印度的所有地区想实现最健康的饮食会对印度的环境资源造成更大的压力。显然，这样健康，可持续的饮食在很多地方是不现实的。在大部分贫苦地区，人们想得更多的是吃什么能满足人的最基本营养而不是健康。基于地区情况给出的合适的饮食方式才是如今最可行的方式。

<!-- This paper focuses on the investigations and experiments that scientists have conducted to understand the shortcomings of existing diets in order to find a diet that takes into account both human nutrition and the natural environment.
The paper begins by describing a small experiment conducted by Lora Iannotti and her Kenyan colleagues in Mombasa, Kenya, to understand "what marine food choices we can make for ecosystem health and health in our diet". The scientists found that people's dietary habits so far have not only caused more serious health problems for people, but also caused more harm to the existing environment.
In view of this situation, they jointly published a report calling for dietary changes. The main environmental problem associated with the diet is the amount of greenhouse gas pollution that accompanies food production, so the scientists called on people to change to a plant-based diet and developed a basic healthy recipe consisting of whole foods. They have received a lot of criticism from various quarters. Some scientists have taken a different approach, working on sustainable eating habits from an early age to address the problems associated with existing diets, and improving the structure of the diet above.
But it is clearly impossible for everyone to achieve such a healthy diet, and there is real resistance. The first thing is to find out what people are eating in some low- or middle-income areas. One scientist also pointed out that trying to achieve the healthiest diet in all regions of India with the available resources would put more pressure on India's environmental resources. Clearly, such a healthy, sustainable diet is unrealistic in many places. In most poor areas, people think more about what they can eat to meet their basic nutritional needs than about health. An appropriate diet based on regional conditions is the most feasible approach today. -->
